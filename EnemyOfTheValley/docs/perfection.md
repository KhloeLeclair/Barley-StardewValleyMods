# Perfection

You can still achieve perfection with this mod installed!

To acquire recipes only learned by mail by befriending NPCs, you may instead buy the recipes from the Saloon when you have at least the corresponding *negative* heart amount with that NPC.
For example, the Salad recipe is usually learned from Emily at 3 hearts. You can instead buy it from the Saloon if you have -3 (or -4, or -5, etc.) hearts with Emily.
